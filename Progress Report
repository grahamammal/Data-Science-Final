Main Questions:
1. What is the correlation between weather and ridership on Metro Transit and Niceride?
*How do bikeshare ridership patterns vary depending on temperature compared to buses?
*What other weather factors besides temperature influence ridership of Niceride and Metro Transit?

2. Is there a correlation between proximity of  a Niceride Station to a bus stop and usage patterns of Niceride stations?
*How do Niceride usage patterns vary over the course of one weekday? (Do the stations less than 500 meters from a bus stop have spikes in usage when a bus lets out?)
