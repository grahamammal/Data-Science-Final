#More research Questions:
1. weather- factors other than temperature
2. does temp diff on a day actually matter or is it just a side effect of something else?
3. closer look at niceride time usage data over a specific day to find trends
4. understand how any relationships change based on holidays or other special days
5. figure out how many niceride stations are near bus stations compared to ones that arent?
6. variability in temperature throughout the year
